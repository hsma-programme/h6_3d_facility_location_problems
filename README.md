## Learning Objectives

### Facility Location Problems

Students should be able to:

- Explain the difference between p-median facility location problems, maximal covering location problems (MCLP), and location set covering problems (LSCP) 
- Code a brute-force solution to a small-scale p-median optimization problem
- Evaluate and visualise solutions to small-scale p-median optimization problems
- Explain why it is not possible to evaluate every solution in larger optimization problems
- Explain the benefits and limitations of using random restarts on larger problems
- Explain the high-level principles of evolutionary algorithms for tackling larger-scale optimisation problems
